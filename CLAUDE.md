# Double Interlock: notes for working on this code

A browser sim game about data center fire protection. Vanilla JS, no build step, no dependencies.
Read README.md first for what the game is.

## Run and test

- Open `index.html` (loads `src/*.js` as plain scripts, works from `file://`).
- `node build-standalone.js` regenerates `double-interlock.html`. Do this after any change in `src/`.
- Run all of these before calling a change done:
  `node test/solver.test.js && node test/graph.test.js && node test/sim.test.js && node test/proc.test.js && node test/campaign.test.js`
- `node test/ui.play.js out.png` plays contract 1 with real mouse events (Playwright). It has caught
  bugs the headless tests cannot (state created by incremental building).
- `node test/shot.js <scenario|menu> out.png "<js>"` loads the page, optionally runs JS, screenshots.

## Architecture

Everything hangs off one global, `DI`. Each file starts with
`var DI = globalThis.DI || (globalThis.DI = {});` so the engine files also load under Node with `require`.
Load order is the script order in `index.html`.

Engine (no DOM, testable in Node): core, juris, data, world, solver, systems, graph, links, gas, fire,
alarm, sim, calc, review, proc, scen, scen1-3. Front end: manual, audio, glyphs, render, inspect, ui, input, main.

- `DI.World` is the map. Any topology change must bump `W.ver`; `Sim.step` then calls `sync()`.
- `DI.Sim` owns dynamic state. `S.ss` is per system valve: `state` is `dry | filling | wet`.
  Changing a drain, test valve or anything that adds or removes an outlet needs `S.touch()` (graph rebuild).
- Tick order in `Sim.step`: fire -> alarm -> gasPre (trip logic) -> controllers -> build/refresh graph ->
  solve -> readback -> account -> gasPost (fill) -> fireWater -> test procedures.
- The solver sees a reduced graph. Untripped dry systems are not in it at all; their pressure is `s.P`.
- Units everywhere: psi gauge, gpm, gallons, feet, seconds. One tile = 10 ft. Gas is `G = P_abs * V`.
- `W.cfg` holds the site / project settings and is saved with the world: `edition`, `nfpa76Adopted`,
  `pipePolicy`, `detThr`, `manualReleaseBypassP`. Read them through the helpers (`DI.setJuris`,
  `DI.pipePolicy`, `DI.detThr`), which supply the defaults. A settings change must bump `W.ver`.
  `DI.juris` is the active edition row; `Sim.sync()` and `DI.review()` refresh it from the world.

## Company locks (do not relax these without a Lead decision)

- Wet, dry and double-interlock preaction only. There is no release mode on `prev`.
- Preaction trip (`gas.js`): `(sol OR pull) AND pLatch`. `sol` = Fire 1 through the panel, `pull` = the
  panel manual station typed DETECTION, `pLatch` = pipe pressure fell below `pTrip` while the valve was
  set. `pLatch` clears only in `DI.panelReset` and `DI.resetValve`. Low and high air (`loAir`, `hiAir`)
  are supervisory only and must never feed the trip logic.
- `mech` (mechanical emergency release at the trim) trips the valve directly, outside the panel logic.
- Only `DI.FIRE1` releases. Alert never arms; Fire 2 is never read as a release input.
- Panel failure never releases water: no code path may set `sol`, `pull` or `mech` from `W.power`. A
  missing or dead panel forces `sol` and `pull` false in `alarmStep`.
- Hazen-Williams C is `DI.pipeC()` = 100 for every pipe. No nitrogen credit, no indoor / outdoor split.
- Per-valve setpoints come from the maker trim presets in `DI.TRIMS`. Order: `hiAir > airSet > loAir >
  pTrip`; review fails any other order.
- Label a value the Leads did not fix as ASSUMED in the UI and manual and keep it tunable. Label an open
  engineering choice NEEDS PE REVIEW. The register of both is in README.md and the manual's Site page.
- `test/sim.test.js` holds the acceptance checks for all of the above plus static greps on `src/`.

## Conventions

- Scenario = entry in `DI.SCEN` with `build(W)`, `goals[{t, ok(S), hint}]`, `drill{steps, judge}`.
  Goals are pure predicates on live state; use the helpers in `DI.G`.
- Every contract must stay winnable. If you change costs, hydraulics, fire or timing, rerun
  `test/campaign.test.js`: it plays each contract with the layouts in `test/bot.js` and an operator bot.
  Add a layout there for any new contract.
- Plan review findings carry a code reference built with `DI.ref13()` or `DI.juris.ref.*`, so they follow
  the site's enforced edition (2019 / 2022 / 2025). Keep references at section level unless the exact
  paragraph has been verified, and add edition-specific section numbers only to the table in `juris.js`.
- Player-facing numbers come from the tables in `core.js`, `juris.js` and `data.js`; do not hard-code them
  elsewhere. Read a tile's pipe (inside diameter, volume, cost, schedule) with `DI.pipeAt(W, k)`, never
  `DI.PIPES[..].id` directly: the schedule depends on the pipe policy and on main vs branch.
- UI text: plain, specific, no exclamation marks. Explain the why in one sentence.

## Pitfalls already hit

- Coarse time steps: anything with a pressure switch (jockey, compressor) overshoots on a large `dt`
  unless it is clamped the way a regulator would. Long skips set `S.coarse` and freeze hydraulics.
- `findSystems` assigns tiles to the first valve that reaches them. Adjacent mains join automatically,
  so two systems side by side need a capped joint (`W.cut`) or a wall between them.
- When piping is added to a live system, `sync()` rescales gas at constant pressure. Never scale by a
  ratio of volumes: a new valve starts with zero volume.
- Fire department dispatch is suppressed outside drills and sandbox (`S.live`) and while a test runs.
- The inspector panel rebuilds only when its signature changes and acts on mousedown, because the DOM
  is replaced under the cursor.
- Files written through a quoted heredoc contain literal `’` escapes; match on those when patching.
- After any repair on a preaction system P is still latched. A scenario, bot or test that then raises
  detection floods the system unless it resets the panel first (`test/bot.js` does). A trip test on
  `prev` energizes `sol` directly and needs a live wired panel, or `alarmStep` drops it out again.
- `World.fromJSON` migrates old saves (`DI.migratePart`): it drops `mode`, loads the el-el preset where
  setpoints are missing and flags the valve so `Sim.restore` re-pressurizes it. Extend that function
  when part props change.
